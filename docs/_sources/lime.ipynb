    "<h2>Summary</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "Local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME)[[1](ribeiro2016should_lime)] is a method that fits a surrogate glassbox model around the decision space of any blackbox model's prediction. LIME explicitly tries to model the local neighborhood of any prediction -- by focusing on a narrow enough decision surface, even simple linear models can provide good approximations of blackbox model behavior. Users can then inspect the glassbox model to understand how the blackbox model behaves in that region. \n",
    "\n",
    "LIME works by perturbing any individual datapoint and generating synthetic data which gets evaluated by the blackbox system, and ultimately used as a training set for the glassbox model. LIME's advantages are that you can interpret an explanation the same way you reason about a linear model, and that it can be used on almost any model. On the otherhand, explanations are occasionally unstable and highly dependent on the perturbation process.\n",
    "\n",
    "<h2>How it Works</h2>\n",
    "\n",
    "Christoph Molnar's \"Interpretable Machine Learning\" e-book [[2](molnar2020interpretable_lime)] has an excellent overview on LIME that can be found [here](https://christophm.github.io/interpretable-ml-book/lime.html).\n",
    "\n",
    "The conceiving paper \"Why should i trust you?\" Explaining the predictions of any classifier.\" [[1](ribeiro2016should_lime)] can be found on arXiv [here](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1602.04938.pdf).\n",
